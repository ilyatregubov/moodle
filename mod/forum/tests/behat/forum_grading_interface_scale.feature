  Scenario: Test setting up forum grading and test some of the basic functionality.
    # Open the grader interface.
    Given I click on "Grade users" "button"
    And I should see "Grading (Scale Forum)"
    # Navigate between users.
    When I click on "Save changes and proceed to the next user" "button"
    Then I should see "Student 1"
    And I set the field "Grade" to "Very good"
    # Save the grade & Check it shows on user navigation
    And I click on "Save" "button"
    And I click on "Save changes and proceed to the next user" "button"
    And I should see "Student 2"
    And the field "Grade" does not match value "Very good"
    And I click on "Save changes and proceed to the previous user" "button"
    And I should see "Student 1"
    And the field "Grade" matches value "Very good"
    # Confirm the grade is now in the grading report.
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I navigate to "View > User report" in the course gradebook
    And I click on "Student 1" in the "user" search widget
    And the following should exist in the "user-grade" table:
