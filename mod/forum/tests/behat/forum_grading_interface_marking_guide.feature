      | Guide criterion A | Guide A description for students | Guide A description for markers | 30            |

      | Comment 3   |
      | Comment "4" |
    When I press "Save marking guide and make it ready"
    Then I should see "Ready for use"
    And I should see "Guide criterion A"
    And I should see "Guide criterion B"
    And I should see "Guide criterion C"
    And I should see "Comment 1"
    And I should see "Comment 2"
    And I should see "Comment 3"
    And I should see "Comment \"4\""
    And I navigate to "Forum" in current page administration
    # Open the grader interface.
    And I click on "Grade users" "button"
    And I click on "Save changes and proceed to the next user" "button"
    # Xpaths used to get around the name needing to be a very specific dynamic name.
    And I set the field with xpath "//input[contains(@aria-label,'Guide criterion A score')]" to "25"
    And I set the field with xpath "//textarea[contains(@aria-label,'Additional comments for criterion, Guide criterion A')]" to "Very good"
    And I set the field with xpath "//input[contains(@aria-label,'Guide criterion B score')]" to "20"
    And I set the field with xpath "//input[contains(@aria-label,'Guide criterion C score')]" to "35"
    And I set the field with xpath "//textarea[contains(@aria-label,'Additional comments for criterion, Guide criterion C')]" to "Nice!"
    And I click on "Save changes and proceed to the previous user" "button"
    And the field with xpath "//textarea[contains(@aria-label,'Additional comments for criterion, Guide criterion A')]" does not match value "Very good"
    And I click on "Save changes and proceed to the next user" "button"
    And the field with xpath "//textarea[contains(@aria-label,'Additional comments for criterion, Guide criterion A')]" matches value "Very good"
    # Confirm the grade is now in the grading report.
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I navigate to "View > User report" in the course gradebook
    And I click on "Student 1" in the "user" search widget
    And the following should exist in the "user-grade" table:
