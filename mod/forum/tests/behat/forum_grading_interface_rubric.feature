    And I define the following rubric:

    When I press "Save rubric and make it ready"
    Then I should see "Ready for use"
    And I click on "Rubric Forum" "link"
    # Open the grader interface.
    And I click on "Grade users" "button"
    And I click on "Save changes and proceed to the next user" "button"
    And I click on "Level 14" "radio"
    And I click on "Level 21" "radio"
    And I click on "Level 31" "radio"
    # Xpaths used to get around the name needing to be a very specific dynamic name.
    And I set the field with xpath "//textarea[contains(@aria-label,'Criterion 1 remark')]" to "Well done"
    And I set the field with xpath "//textarea[contains(@aria-label,'Criterion 2 remark')]" to "Nice effort"
    And I set the field with xpath "//textarea[contains(@aria-label,'Criterion 3 remark')]" to "A lot of room to grow"
    And I click on "Save changes and proceed to the previous user" "button"
    And the field with xpath "//textarea[contains(@aria-label,'Criterion 1 remark')]" does not match value "Well done"
    And I click on "Save changes and proceed to the next user" "button"
    And the field with xpath "//textarea[contains(@aria-label,'Criterion 1 remark')]" matches value "Well done"
    # Confirm the grade is now in the grading report.
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I navigate to "View > User report" in the course gradebook
    And I click on "Student 1" in the "user" search widget
